## One-channel data plotting

- This example has been built to view any stream of data you have just collected
- Just type in the tag-type you want to display in the `data_types` variable
- **NOTE** - If you are running the script on spyder using anaconda navigator, you may have to run the command `%matplotlib qt`
on the console to generate the plot on a separate window.
